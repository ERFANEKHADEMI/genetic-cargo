# Genetic Algorithm for Optimized Truck Loading 🚚🧬

A genetic algorithm implementation in Java to optimize the selection of items to be loaded onto a truck. The objective is to maximize the total value of the load while ensuring that the weight limit of the truck is not exceeded.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to find the best combination of items.
- **Item Selection**: Selects items based on their value and weight.
- **Weight Limit**: Ensures that the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the truck's weight limit.
- **Optimization**: Seeks to maximize the total value of the loaded items.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 🐍 (For running the application)
